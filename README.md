Animal Image Classifier

A deep learning web app that classifies images of animals into 15 different categories using Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2). Upload a photo of an animal, and the model will tell you which animal it is. 

What It Does?

- Accepts image uploads via a simple web interface
- Preprocesses the image (resize, normalize)
- Uses a trained MobileNetV2 model to classify the image
- Displays the predicted animal class with a clean UI


How It Works

This project uses **Transfer Learning** with the **MobileNetV2** architecture, fine-tuned on a custom dataset of 15 animal categories. It was trained using TensorFlow and deployed using Streamlit Cloud for easy accessibility.
